TODO
----


v0.1:
 * Battery compartment is not quite wide enough.
 * Battery compartment battery spring slot is:
   - 0.5mm too thin, should be 1.6mm
   - 0.5mm too slim, should me 17.75mm
 * Spring slots lack copper on the back side
 * Missing +/- symbols on the battery silkscreen
 ? Rotate battery footprint 180 degrees

 * Mic port hole is not drilled (hole too small?)
 * Mic pads should probably be longer

 * Move button footprint slightly closer to edge

 * BNO055 pads should probable be longer

 * FIXED: Make logos bigger to make details visible

 * FIXED: Change L2 footprint from 0603 to 1206

 * Vin not connected on 3.3V regulator
